# Multi PHP Composer

A command line tool to help running composer using different PHP versions.

Requires my another CLI app: [MultiPHP](https://github.com/LevineLighto/rust-multiphp)


## Usage
```bash
# Syntax
multicomposer {php-version} {whatever-you-want-to-do}

# Example (New Laravel project)
multicomposer 8.3 create-project laravel/laravel new-laravel-project
```
